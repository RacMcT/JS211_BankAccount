//Functions for BankAccount Class:
// balance(amt)
// deposit()
// charge(payee, amt)


//The class should have the following 3 methods:
// balance() - This method does not take any input, and returns the current balance on the account. The balance is computed by summing up the amounts in the transactions array.

// deposit(amt) - This method takes in a single input, the deposit amount. This method should create a new transaction representing the deposit, and add it to the transactions array.
// NOTE: You should not be able to deposit a negative amount

// charge(payee, amt) - This method takes in the payee and amount, creates a new transaction with the payee and amount, and adds the transaction to the transaction array.
// NOTE: You should not be able to charge an amount that would make your balance dip below 0
